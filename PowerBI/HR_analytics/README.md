## Introduction

The goal of this project is to help the HR team identify key metrics and actions to improve employee retention. The data is from a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs.

Using Power BI, I imported, cleaned, and analyzed six CSV datasets: `Date`, `EducationLevel`, `Employee`, `RatingLevel`, `SatisfiedLevel`, and `PerformanceRating`. Through exploratory data analysis and DAX calculations, I created visualisations to uncover insights into employee satisfaction, performance, and tenure. By understanding these factors, the company can develop targeted strategies to boost employee retention.


## Importing and cleaning the data

I initiated a new Power BI report and imported five CSV datasets: `EducationLevel`, `Employee`, `RatingLevel`, `SatisfiedLevel`, and `PerformanceRating`. To clarify the table roles, I prepended 'Fact' or 'Dim' to each table name, designating them as either fact or dimension tables.

Next, I ensure that the columns were correctly formatted following the [Metadata table](metadata.md). Then, I created a new calculated table using DAX code from the [DimDate.txt](DimDate.txt) file and connected it to the FactPerformanceRating table in the Model view. I also connected it to the DimEmployee table to star building the model for our data.
