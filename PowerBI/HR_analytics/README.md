# HR analytics project in Power BI

**A guided project from DataCampÂ´s career track: [Data Analyst in Power BI.](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-analyst-in-power-bi)**

## Introduction 
The goal of this project is to help the HR team identify key metrics and actions to improve employee retention. The data is from a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs.

Using Power BI, I imported, cleaned, and analyzed five CSV datasets: `Date`, `EducationLevel`, `Employee`, `RatingLevel`, `SatisfiedLevel`, and `PerformanceRating`. Through exploratory data analysis and DAX calculations, I created visualisations to uncover insights into employee satisfaction, performance, and tenure. By understanding these factors, the company can develop targeted strategies to boost employee retention.

## Importing the data
First, I created a blank report and imported the five CSV datasets: `Date`, `EducationLevel`, `Employee`, `RatingLevel`, `SatisfiedLevel`, and `PerformanceRating`.
