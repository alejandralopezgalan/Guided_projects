## Introduction 
The dataset is from a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. The company's HR team wants to monitor key metrics on employees. The dataset has five tables: `Date`, `EducationLevel`, `Employee`, `RatingLevel`, `SatisfiedLevel`, and `PerformanceRating`, 

You’ll carry out exploratory data analysis and will use DAX to help build powerful visualizations. You’ll finish your analysis by diving deeper into attrition and what factors impact attrition. This analysis will help the organization determine what action they will need to take to retain more employees.
