## Introduction

The goal of this project is to help the HR team identify key metrics and actions to improve employee retention. The data is from a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs.

Using Power BI, I imported, cleaned, and analyzed six CSV datasets: `Date`, `EducationLevel`, `Employee`, `RatingLevel`, `SatisfiedLevel`, and `PerformanceRating`. Through exploratory data analysis and DAX calculations, I created visualisations to uncover insights into employee satisfaction, performance, and tenure. By understanding these factors, the company can develop targeted strategies to boost employee retention.

## Importing and cleaning the data to build the data model

I initiated a new Power BI report and imported five CSV datasets: `EducationLevel`, `Employee`, `RatingLevel`, `SatisfiedLevel`, and `PerformanceRating`. To clarify the table roles, I prepended 'Fact' or 'Dim' to each table name, designating them as either fact or dimension tables. Next, I ensured that the columns were correctly formatted following the [Metadata table](metadata.md). Then, I created a new date calculated table using the DAX code from [DimDate.txt](DimDate.txt) file.

<br/>Once the data was loaded and cleaned, I create a data model to establish the relatioships between tables. This image shows the initial data model.

## Exploring the data

### Overview
I created a table with all the measures for the analysis. I used DAX formulas for these measures.

| Measure | Description | DAX code |
| :--- | --- | :--- |
| `TotalEmployees` | The total count of the employees in the company | `TotalEmployees = DISTINCTCOUNT(DimEmployee[EmployeeID])` |
| `ActiveEmployees` | Active employees in the company | `ActiveEmployees = CALCULATE(COUNT(DimEmployee[EmployeeID]), FILTER(DimEmployee, DimEmployee[Attrition] = "No"))` |
| `InactiveEmployees` | Employees that left the company | `InactiveEmployees = CALCULATE(COUNT(DimEmployee[EmployeeID]), FILTER(DimEmployee, DimEmployee[Attrition] = "Yes"))` |
| `% Attrition Rate` | Percentage of Attrition Rate of the company | `% Attrition Rate = DIVIDE([InactiveEmployees], [TotalEmployees])`. |
| `TotalEmployeesDate` | Count of total employees by date |`TotalEmployeesDate = CALCULATE([TotalEmployees], USERELATIONSHIP(DimDate[Date], DimEmployee[HireDate]))`.  |
